# conductor-agent
agent for guiding teams of humans and AI to success

# Origin
inspired by agents “hiring” humans but since the trust system is a bit too complex and not likely to work (and other issues), i think its more correct to get an agent to assign tasks as efficient as possible to humans and other agents, knowing each and own’s capabilities and timelines and context.
